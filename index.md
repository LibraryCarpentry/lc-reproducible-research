Given that open science is at the core of librariesâ€™ work and many librarians provide
direct and increasingly hands-on support to both early career and senior researchers at
their institutions, a good understanding of reproducibility and its place in the open science landscape is critical. Moreover, as funders, journals, and other stakeholders
begin to implement new requirements for open and reproducible research, librarians
need to know how not only openness but also reproducibility can be achieved in
academic research. Librarians also need to be aware of how differently the
implementation of reproducible research workflows can look in across different disciplines and research methodologies.

Based on that, the current lesson proposal focuses on helping librarians understand the
concept of reproducibility and learn about both theoretical and practical aspects of
reproducible research workflows. It also aims to prompt further development of library
support services in this area through harnessing existing expertise in academic libraries.


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to: 

* explain what research reproducibility is
* list at least 4 benefits and challenges of reproducible research
* provide examples where reproducibility is not the same as open science (or: does not overlap with)
* explain how different disciplines define reproducibility differently
* provide examples of reproducible research workflows
* list at least 4 different tools and practices for increasing research reproducibility
* demonstrate basic understanding of how to use selected tools for increasing research reproducibility
* provide examples of how libraries can support research reproducibility and its improvement
