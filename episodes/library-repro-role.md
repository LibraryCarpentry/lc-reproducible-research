## Why Libraries?

Libraries are well positioned to support reproducible research. Many already promote open access, open data, and good documentation practices. These skills and services align closely with reproducibility goals.

As funders and journals begin to expect not only open but also reproducible research, libraries can expand their support. Librarians work across disciplines and with researchers at all career stages. This makes them key partners in promoting transparency and improving research workflows.

## How Libraries Support Reproducibility

Libraries can help by:

- Raising awareness and offering training on reproducible research
- Supporting transparent research practices, including documenting methods, sharing data, and explaining analysis steps
- Helping researchers create clear, consistent documentation for all stages of a project
- Advising on version control tools to track changes in code, data, or manuscripts
- Reviewing data and workflows to improve quality and clarity
- Assisting researchers in reproducing their own results
