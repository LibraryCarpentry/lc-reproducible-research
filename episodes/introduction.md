## Why is this important?
The topic of reproducible research is important for several reasons:

- Making research more reproducible contributes to continuous research improvement
- Recent discussions of reproducibility crisis, that is many research studies being irreproducible, call for the need to broader awareness and increased skills in research reproducibility
- Open and reproducible research are becoming the norm around the world following many global changes in how academic research is conducted, including a broad science reform around the world
- Transparent, rigorous and reproducible research is an integral part of research integrity and responsible research conduct that researchers should follow

To summarize, more reproducible research means: research improvement, mitigating reproducibility crisis, contributing to ongoing science reform and responsible research conduct.
