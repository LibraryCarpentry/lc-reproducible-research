:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What do we mean by reproducibility?
- When is research reproducible?
- Does reproducibility mean different things in different disciplines?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Explain what research reproducibility is
- Provide examples where reproducibility is not the same as open science (or: does not overlap with)
- Explain how different disciplines define reproducibility differently

## Reproducibility: Some Definitions

**Reproducibility** means obtaining the same results with the same data

**Replicability** means obtaining similar results with new data

Research is **reproduced** when results are consistent when following the same method and analysis steps with the same input data

Research is **replicated** when results are consistent across studies that answer the same research question, each of which has obtained its own data

Research results are **generalized** when results apply in other contexts or populations that differ from the original one

## Reproducibility Across Methodologies and Research Disciplines

**Quantitative Studies: Computational Reproducibility**

It is defined as “obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis” ([https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303)). What it means is basically re-running analyses/code with the same data.

**Qualitative Studies: Process Transparency**

Here we mean arriving at a similar (consistent) interpretation by following the same analysis process. This could be obtained by following the step-by-step reasoning and interpretation process of the researcher(s).

## Reproducibility and Open Research
**Reproducibility is strongly associated with transparency. **
In order to reproduce others’ studies we need to have access to the methods, data, and analyses that have been conducted. So making data, tools and analyses available is essential for reproducibility. 

**Reproducible does not (have to) mean fully open.**
However, a reproducible project does not have to be fully open. For example, due to privacy or copyright restrictions on methods, data, or analyses, researchers might need to keep parts of the research outputs under controlled access (e.g. available only to other researchers and not publicly available). This should not prevent then, though, from making the project fully reproducible (e.g. internally within their research team). 

**Open does not mean reproducible.**
On the other hand, it is entirely possible to practice open science without following reproducibility principles. Materials, data, tools and code can be made openly available but if they don’t have necessary documentation, instruction on how to use them, error checks, proper versioning and organization - they are most probably not usable, and the project might not be reproducible.

## Reproducibility Crisis

Problems with reproducibility of research have been noticed by many researchers, advisors and policy makers in the past several years and led to some even claim that there is a [“Reproducibility crisis”](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a).
However, not everyone agrees.

**Reasons for Irreproducibility**

- Unavailability of materials, data and/or analyses
- Poor data management
- Unclear analysis specification
- Lack of documentation
- Errors in reporting numbers
- Lack of quality checking procedures
- Insufficient peer review
