:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can science benefit from reproducible research?
- How can researchers benefit personally from reproducibility?
- What are the main challenges in making research reproducible?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify at least four benefits of reproducible research
- Explain how reproducibility supports research integrity
- List at least four challenges researchers face
- Give one example of how support services can address a challenge

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Benefits for Science

Reproducibility strengthens research by making it:

- Easier to **verify**, helping others detect errors
- More likely to be **accurate**, since processes are transparent
- Easier to **understand** and **reuse**, through documentation
- Simpler to **share**, when licensing or privacy allow

## Benefits for Researchers

Reproducibility also helps individual researchers:

- Become more **efficient**: while setup takes time, it saves time later
- Feel more **confident**, knowing their work can be checked and reused
- Gain **recognition**: reproducible outputs are valued in grant reviews and assessments

::: discussion

Name one benefit of reproducibility for science and one for individual researchers. Why are these important?

## Common Challenges

Despite the benefits, reproducibility can be hard to achieve. Some common obstacles:

- It takes **time** to adopt new workflows or improve documentation
- It requires **skills** in tools, formats, and platforms
- **Legal or ethical restrictions** may limit what can be shared
- **Technical barriers** can arise from software changes or compatibility issues

## How to Support Reproducibility

These challenges can be addressed with the right support:

- **Time**: Institutions and funders can recognize reproducible outputs and allow time for preparation
- **Skills**: Training and support staff can help researchers learn best practices
- **Restrictions**: Secure platforms and internal review can enable controlled sharing
- **Technical issues**: Guidance on software documentation and environment capture can help others reproduce results

::: discussion

Pick one challenge researchers face when making their work reproducible.  
Talk with a partner about how you, as a librarian or support staff member, could help address that challenge.

::: keypoints

- Reproducibility improves research quality and benefits both science and individual researchers
- It can be difficult due to time, skills, legal, and technical challenges
- Support services like training, infrastructure, and guidance are key to helping researchers succeed
